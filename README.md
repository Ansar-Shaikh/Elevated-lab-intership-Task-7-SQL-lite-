Sales Summary using SQLite and Python
 What I Did

Created a small SQLite database (sales_data.db) with one table: sales.

Inserted a sample dataset containing products, quantity, and price.

Wrote SQL queries in Python to calculate:

Total quantity sold per product

Total revenue (quantity * price) per product

Fetched results into Pandas DataFrame for easy display.

Printed the sales summary in tabular form.

Created a bar chart with Matplotlib to show revenue by product.

Saved and displayed the chart inside Jupyter Notebook.

 Outcome

A tiny SQLite database with sales data.

SQL + Python integration demonstration.

Clean summary report with product-wise totals.

Visualization of revenue by product.
